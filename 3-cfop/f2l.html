			<h2>What is F2l?</h2>
			<p> F2l stands for First 2 Layers. We solve the first two layers in one go which is a jump from the 'beginner method', where you solve layer by layer. It may seem slower at first, but it's worth it: proffesional cubers have even solved F2L in as low as 3 seconds in some cases!

			<h2> Tips </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Aim to reduce regrips and rotations by inserting from the back as well as the front</li>
				<li>Try to get efficient solutions for cases before developing muscle memory for them</li>
			</ul>
