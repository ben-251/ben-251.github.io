# Additions
- [ ] comments (disqus?)
- [ ] tag-based rss/email
- [ ] footnotes

# hugo/md tweaks
- [ ] go through all old pages to remove "# Notes" "# References" or "# Notes and References", then make that heading automatically add itself if the frontmatter includes `hasNotes,` then everything will be super clean!

# UI/UX-improvements
- [x] make the "last updated" not part of the 3 mini tag things. Either put it under or above or something
- [x] make the header sizes on mobile smaller and the title font size bigger (atm h1's are literally larger than the title...)
- [x] make the page header capitalisation consistent
- [ ] make the backnext buttons appear at the top too, for easier navigation
- [x] make the last updated only show on desktop

# Bugs
- [x] On the home page, /poems creates a blank item for some reason (probably draft related somehow)
- [x] theme is broken again; changing theme doesn't stay when you change page. it reverts to the default of white peony.
- [x] theme is not broken now, but laggy
- [x] fix odd deploy issue?

# Mobile vs Desktop
- [x] Layout of settings on mobile is now broken
