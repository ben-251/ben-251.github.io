- [ ] Make a python file that turns blog md into html, in the format and class-ing I want, to speed up the writing process (can even just write in obsidian or something) 
- [ ] Find a cleaner more standard way to get the dropdown on blog in navbar, that way I can have it push other elements down when the objects appear
