# Main
(Analysing the metaphysical properties of zinc-based dinosaur toys in n-spaced dimensions)
As I'm sure you know, zinc throughout the years has been responsible for many dinosaur toy deaths, due to the oversaturation of their mirrored psyche in the trigonal lattice form fucntions. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to analyse and compute certain potentially hazardous metaphysical properties that result in increased charge of the p-positve ions across the system of linearity, proposed by John G. Stone in his excellent paper.

## Main Ideas
In order to solve this, we must first analyze the systems in which metaphysical decay does not occur, then reverse-engineer a hypothetical vector field formed under the assumption of least innocence. 
The next major #hashtag-to-be-ignored step is to recreate the Fritz-Friedrich equations for this specific field, in order to detect as many psychological states in the dinosaurs' brains as possible.
