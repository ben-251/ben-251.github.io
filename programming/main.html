				<h1> 1. DRY (Don't repeat yourself)</h1>
				<p>Our first object-oriented design principle is DRY, as the name suggests <span class = "mild-emphasis"> DRY (don't repeat yourself) </span> means don't write duplicate code, instead use Abstraction to abstract common things in one place.
					If you have a block of code in more than two places consider making it a separate method, or if you use a hard-coded value more than one time make them public final constant. The benefit of this Object-oriented design principle is in maintenance.
