This is an introduction to my new model of art and poetics. The goal of this series of posts is to walk you through my thinking, to provide you with a new, powerful way to think about creating and analysing art. This is not as an objective claim about the actual process that happens in the mind, but a simplified description and exploration of the process on a slightly wider level (much like the Bohr model of the atom, say).

The first 3 chapters focus on art in general, with [the third](art cycle 3) beginning to lean into poetics; from there, all future chapters will focus specifically on poetics.

# Chapters

Once all chapters are published, you can probably read out of order. Just a quick caveat: there may be the odd phrase or sentence that builds directly on previous chapters.

Chapters 2-5 are by no means an exhaustive list of applications. Once you have read the first chapter, there is nothing to say you cannot make your own applications; my emphasis on poetics is in that sense arbitrary.
