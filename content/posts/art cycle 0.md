This is an introduction to my new model of art and poetics. The goal of this series of posts is to walk you through my thinking, to provide you with a new, powerful way to think about creating and analysing art. This is not as an objective claim about the actual process that happens in the mind, but a simplified description and exploration of the process on a slightly wider level (much like the Bohr model of the atom, say).

The first 3 chapters focus on art in general, with [[art cycle 3|the third]] beginning to lean into poetics; from there, all future chapters will focus specifically on poetics.

1. [[art cycle 1|The Art Cycle]] - A deep dive into the fundamentals of my theory
2. [[art cycle 2|Engaging the Cycle]] - An exploration of drafting
3. [[art cycle 3|Analysis of Art]] - Teasing out the complex relationship between artist and audience, and addressing various approaches to close-reading.
4. [[art cycle 4|Elements of Language]] - Revealing how the cycle operates on micro- and macro-levels. (Also branching into a “spin-off” series with the same name)
5. [[art cycle 5|The Force of Form]] - A critique of Lyn Hejinian’s theories on poetic form.
6. [[art cycle 6|What are Metaphors, for?]] - An exploration of the Image, across poetic traditions, in comparison to the SV model.

You can probably read out of order, but there may be the odd phrase or sentence that builds directly on previous chapters. Also, chapters 2-5 are by no means an exhaustive list of applications. Once you have read the first chapter, there is nothing to say you cannot make your own applications; my emphasis on poetics is in that sense arbitrary.
