This is an introduction to my new theory of art and poetics. The goal of this series of posts is to walk you through my thinking, to provide you with a new, powerful way to think about creating and analysing art.

The first 3 chapters focus on art in general, with [[art cycle 3|the third]] beginning to lean into poetics; from there, all future chapters will focus specifically on poetics.

Outline: %% set to use {{ .Title }} - {{ . Subtitle }} as a forloop in an ol %%
1. [[art cycle 1|The Art Cycle]] - A deep dive into the fundamentals of my theory
2. [[art cycle 2|Engaging the Cycle]] - An exploration of drafting
3. [[art cycle 3|Analysis of Art]] - Teasing out the complex relationship between artist and audience, and addressing various approaches to close-reading.
4. [[art cycle 4|Elements of Language]] - Revealing how the cycle operates on micro- and macro-levels.
5. [[art cycle 5|The Force of Form]] - A critique of Lyn Hejinian’s theories on poetic form.

You can probably read out of order, but there may be the odd phrase or sentence that builds directly on previous chapters. Also, chapters 2-5 are by no means an exhaustive list of applications. Once you have read the first chapter, there is nothing to say you cannot make your own applications; my emphasis on poetics is in that sense arbitrary.
