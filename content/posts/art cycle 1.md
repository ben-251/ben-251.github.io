description: A deep dive into the fundamentals of my theory
---
You are on a walk with your family, exploring a local park, feeling largely uninspired for your next project, when you see a rock. The mossy rock, one of several around you, should not interest, let alone inspire, you, but for some reason it does. Maybe it is the way the light hits one half of the rock, creating a bold shadow across its stippled surface. Maybe the way the rock leans against the tree, with a mini crater of soil as proof for its dislodging, builds a curiosity in you. Maybe it is the brown layer on the back of the moss where someone peeled it, a surprising contrast to the yellow-green everywhere else. You are captivated, and when you go home, you decide to represent that response, whatever it was, through your medium. You experiment and tweak and frown and revisit, and, at the end of an embarrassingly long process, you create something which you can engage with, and on engagement experience a powerful one, like the one that inspired you. Congratulations, you have just created art.$^1$

This description could have applied to a painter copying a rock from memory or direct observation; a poet describing the rock and its details, or even a musician composing a lyric-less song. The process could have applied to any artform, and in fact, I posit that the existence of this progression is what *defines* the process of ‘art’.

# 1. The Mossy Rock and Responses
In the above example, the object of interest to the artist was a rock, which is about as stable and tangible as can be. However, this does not have to be the only way of engaging with the artistic process. In describing the poetry movement ‘Confessionalism,’ Lucy Collins writes$^2$ that “The expression of personal pain has been regarded as a hallmark of confessional poetry,” citing “destructive family relationships; traumatic childhoods; broken marriages; recurring mental breakdowns; alcoholism or drug abuse” as examples from the key writers of the movement. It would be difficult to claim that writing with “undisguised exposure$^3$” about these experiences is outside the scope of artistic expression, and my claim is that the object of an art process need not be tangible.$^4$ 

There is, however, a clear rub between the intangibility of objects and the intangibility of a response to them. My claim is that while objects can be a whole host of things, from physical objects or places to ideas or events, the response exists only emotionally and intellectually (that is, internally).
# 2. The Medium Space
What is the medium that an artist creates with? Maybe paint, or a typewriter? For these explorations, I prefer to refer to those as tools, and reserve the word ‘medium’ for a special concept. For me, a **medium** is a category within an art form, such as the linguistic, visual, and sonic categories (all of which are invoked in songwriting and poetry), which break down further into elements (the sentence, the line, colour, shape, pitch, rhythm and so on), and which form a backbone for creation and interpretation. I don’t concern myself too much with defining exactly what media fit into each artform, because there is a good deal of overlap and the grey areas are not too interesting. Instead, I focus on how elements function within a work, how they tend to play within their medium, how they influence elements from other media, and so on. Another point is that art *forms* are specific traditions and shapes of the much more general act of artistic expression. Thus, I refer to a general, loose set of categories not as an artform but as a **medium space.**

There are two ways to work with any given medium space:
1. To treat media as a means to an end, preferably quite “invisible,” functioning merely to reach an end response, and
2. To treat media as material worthy of being observed and consciously felt.$^5$

I refer to the former as engaging with the **Specular,** and the latter as engaging with the **Visceral.**

# The Specular
A Specular-focused approach aims to place the audience in the exact position of the artist, either to have them form their unique response, or to guide them toward the original response of the author. I tend to use the term “author” to refer to the second mindset, because it emphasises the “authority” imagined by the artist, and I say imagined because, as I explain fully later, a pure form of the Specular does not exist.

\[Examples from the Imagist movement and Statue of J on a Bench]

# The Visceral
If an artist targets their object through the Visceral, they do it only from their peripheral. In an pure or extreme case, the focus is hardly about the specifics of the object, and more about the way their medium replicates a response from the author, or, like earlier, invites the audience to find their own responses from the way the medium has been manipulated. 

\[Example in saying most music does this well, but particularly Steve Reich and Okkyung Lee’s *Ghil,* the way her sound so easily washes over you and starts to be strangely soothing??]

# Which is better?
Engaging with the Visceral is effective if and only if the instinctive focus makes its way to some concrete feeling or conclusion, some rich response. Engaging with the Specular is effective if and only if representation of the object is such that the audience can feel or conclude anything about it. In that sense, both approaches draw on the same ultimate evaluative question, and are in that sense inextricably linked. The connection deepens with the fact that it is virtually impossible to write a fully Specular piece. To be fully Specular would require the medium space to be fully invisible, which as Lyn Hejinian writes, \[quote]$^6$. To be fully Visceral, on the other hand, simply requires the removal of all direct communicative power, to not be “claiming anything,” which is much closer to being possible, through forms like dance and music, for example. This is not to say that all dance and music is fully Visceral. These art forms are capable of engaging with the Specular, 

# Notes
1. I grimace at this sentence, particularly the phrase “created art.” I would rather say “Congratulations, you have just *arted*,” but to avoid overloading the analysis with new terms and jargon, nonetheless, if you pay careful attention to my obstinate phrasing, you will surely find the spirit of ‘art as action’ implicit throughout my arguments,

4. In fact, it very rarely is. Lyn Hejinian’s exploration of the “Event” really nails this idea home. (see todo)
5. At the time of writing this, I am heavily exploring the latter, so I can only apologise for any bias in phrasing—I wholeheartedly believe in the necessity and value of both approaches.
