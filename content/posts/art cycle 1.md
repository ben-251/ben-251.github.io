description: A deep dive into the fundamentals of my theory
---
You are on a walk with your family, exploring a local park, feeling largely uninspired for your next project, when you see a rock. The mossy rock, one of several around you, should not interest, let alone inspire, you, but for some reason it does. Maybe it is the way the light hits one half of the rock, creating a bold shadow across its stippled surface. Maybe the way the rock leans against the tree, with a mini crater of soil as proof for its dislodging, builds a curiosity in you. Maybe it is the brown layer on the back of the moss where someone peeled it, a surprising contrast to the yellow-green everywhere else. You are captivated, and when you go home, you decide to represent that response, whatever it was, through your medium. You experiment and tweak and frown and revisit, and, at the end of an embarrassingly long process, you create something which you can engage with, and on engagement experience a powerful one, like the one that inspired you. Congratulations, you have just created art.$^1$

This description could have applied to a painter copying a rock from memory or direct observation; a poet describing the rock and its details, or even a musician composing a lyric-less song. The process could have applied to any artform, and in fact, I posit that the existence of this progression is what *defines* the process of ‘art’.

{{< figure src="/art_cycle.png" alt="A graph of the Art Cycle, showing an arrow from object to initial response, then into a box named ‘the Medium’ with two circles named ‘Visceral/Gut’ and ‘Specular/Mirror’, then from there to a box called ‘Finished work’ and finally a ‘simulated response’" caption="A graph of the Art Cycle" >}}

# The Mossy Rock
In the above example, the object of interest to the artist was a rock, which is about as stable and tangible as can be. However, this does not have to be the only way of engaging with the artistic process. In describing the poetry movement ‘Confessionalism,’ Lucy Collins writes$^2$ that “The expression of personal pain has been regarded as a hallmark of confessional poetry,” citing “destructive family relationships; traumatic childhoods; broken marriages; recurring mental breakdowns; alcoholism or drug abuse” as examples from the key writers of the movement. It would be difficult to claim that writing with “undisguised exposure$^3$” about these experiences is outside the scope of artistic expression, and my claim is that the object of an art process need not be tangible.$^4$ 

There is, however, a clear rub between the intangibility of objects and the intangibility of a response to them. My claim is that while objects can be a whole host of things, from physical objects or places to ideas or events, the response exists only emotionally and intellectually (that is, internally).
# The Medium Space
What is the medium that an artist creates with? Maybe paint, or a typewriter? For my purposes, I refer to those as tools, and reserve the word ‘**medium**’ for a specific category within art forms. Consider songwriting, where the linguistic, the visual, and the sonic all collaborate to convey meaning (incidentally, poetry also works with these three categories). You could break these down further into elements (the sentence, the line, colour, shape, pitch, rhythm and so on), but taken together they form a backbone for creation and interpretation. I don’t concern myself too much with defining exactly what media fit into each artform, because there is a good deal of overlap and the grey areas are not too interesting. Instead, I focus on how elements function within a work, how they tend to play within their medium, how they influence elements from other media, and so on. Another point is that art *forms* are specific traditions and shapes of the much more general act of artistic expression. Thus, when thinking of a general, loose set of categories, I use the terms ‘**medium space,**’ or sometimes simply ‘**media**’.

There are two extremes when working with any given medium space:
1. To treat media as a means to an end, preferably quite “invisible,” functioning merely to reach an end response, and
2. To treat media as material worthy of being observed and consciously felt.$^5$

The former I call “engaging with the **Specular,**” and the latter “engaging with the **Visceral.**” We take some time now to explore these two modes of thinking.

# The Specular
A Specular-focused approach places the audience in the exact position of the artist, faithfully reflecting the objects that inspired them, that is, allowing using the medium as a specular surface. When looking in a mirror, the goal is not to see the mirror at all; it is to see what the mirror reflects. In a similar sense, the Specular is concerned with making the media as invisible as possible.

A friend of mine encountered this media invisibility quite directly through Timothy Schmalz’ sculpture ‘Homeless Jesus,’ portraying a homeless person asleep on a bench. He, like several people who saw the sculpture, was initially fooled into seeing a real person asleep there, and so any feelings of compassion or deep emotion were, from his reference point, directed at reality, not a representation of it; the media of the statue was fully invisible. In a situation like this, aesthetics and form are clearly not the only point. It is “a social statement, meant to bring awareness to Jesus’ literal connection to homeless people…” and does this by directly representing the artist’s object of inspiration, that is, an actual homeless person, asleep on a bench. 

Examples from poetry would be the *Imagism* and *Confessional* movements, Haiku, Found Poetry, and even the inclusion of Epigraphs. We find strong examples in the storytelling artform through memoir and biography.

# The Visceral
If an artist “looks” at their object in a Visceral work, they do so only from a peripheral angle. Visceral approaches are all about making the medium tangible and drawing attention to all its elements. This is often accomplished by refusing to represent anything directly at all. An example would be a clouded mirror, which forces you to remember the materials of glass and dust and steam that you would otherwise never register. As a result of this indirect focus, visceral work is often quite difficult to analyse: it may engage its audience powerfully on an intuitive level, but it is quite difficult to figure out why. 

Examples from storytelling could include literary fiction (with its strong focus on the media within the art form such as language and character), science fiction, or fantasy. Poetry that taps into this include the work of Gertrude Stein (particularly ‘Tender Buttons’), the Language Poets, and Conceptualism (see Caroline Bergvall’s ‘Drift’)
# On Music
At first, music may appear to be necessarily visceral; its sonic elements are often emotional and textural. However, music is still specular on some$^6$ level; the interaction of its elements can represent emotions in quite honest, up-front ways, allowing listeners to immediately know what feelings are shown to them. In such work, tension and release obey the rules; tonal harmony functions as expected, and so on. When you listen to *Clair de Lune,* you may not immediately guess that one object is “moonlight,” and you would have no reason to guess, solely from observing the work, that it was inspired by a poem of the same name$^7$ (and even less reason to guess the words of that poem). Yet, you will easily conclude that whatever objects inspired it must be quite peaceful, maybe melancholic. The picture it evokes is so clear and transparent that the musical medium does successfully disappear a little—your imagination goes places and you might even stumble on moonlight on your own. There is no denying that a photograph, painting, or poem could get you to the idea of “moonlight and its connotations” much more directly, but nonetheless, Debussy clearly draws from and directly *reflects* the qualities of his objects through his medium, as mentioned by Jessica Duchen: 

> “The work shares the poem’s delicacy, its plangent yet subtle suggestions of mingled sorrow and beauty, and the ‘blue note’ in the middle section – which seems almost to evoke those weeping fountains – encapsulates a certain atmosphere that permeates the entire piece.”$^8$

A more apt candidate for the Visceral can be found in minimal music as with Steve Reich’s *Music for 18 Musicians.* Here, the medium is completely impossible to ignore, with its insistent repetition and structure, slowly evolving but largely pulsing and pounding relentlessly. A work like this is hard to place; it is quite dissonant to the audience. Taking this even further, Okkyung Lee’s *Ghil* fits into the genre of “noise music”—with virtually no clear object to focus on, all we can see is the medium; all we can focus on is the physical clouded mirror. What this piece does to you is significantly hard to place. Some may find it directionless and needlessly chaotic, and others may suggest it taps into something no other music can. I don’t argue for one or the other, but claim that crucially, whatever is happening is *different* to what the more specular pieces do.

# On Language
In both visceral and specular works, the ultimate goal of the artist could be one of two things: to have the audience form their unique response, or to guide them toward the original response of the author. A specular artist could represent a rock as directly as possible in the hopes that their audience will come to the same deep feelings that they experienced, but just as easily, their reason for representing the rock itself may be to allow the audience to form their own reactions and responses. Similarly, a visceral artist could work deeply with their media to represent the abstract essence of the rock as experienced on first inspiration, but equally easily, they could work with their media to let the work open up, allowing the audience to react however they do.

In this sense, both approaches draw on identical evaluative questions, and are therefore inextricably linked. The connection deepens with the fact that it is virtually impossible to write a fully specular or fully visceral piece. To be fully specular would require the medium space to be fully invisible, a concept that the so-called ‘Language Poets’ would disagree with. Lyn Hejinian, for example, argues for the certain material features of language in ‘A Rejection of Closure,’ 

> “Language itself is never in a state of rest. Its syntax can be as complex as thought. And the experience of using it […] is inevitably active—both intellectually and emotionally.”$^{9}$

and later, 

> “…the Incapacity of language to match the world permits us to distinguish our ideas and ourselves from the world and things in it from each other. […] While failing in the attempt to match the world, we discover structure, distinction, the integrity and separateness of things.”$^{10}$

Similarly, when close-reading Gertrude Stein’s infamous ‘A Carafe that is a Blind Glass,’$^{11}$ Lyn Hejinian relies on the anatomy$^{12}$ of Stein’s sentences, referencing *The Principles of Psychology,* where William James argues for the powerful significance of even the most subtle of linguistic features:

> “There is not a conjunction or a preposition, and hardly an adverbial phrase, syntactic form, or inflection of voice, in human speech, that does not express some shading or other of relation which we at some moment actually feel to exist between the larger objects of our thought. \[…] We ought to say a feeling of *and,* a feeling of *if,* a feeling of *but,* and a feeling of *by,* quite as readily as we say a feeling of *blue* or a feeling of *cold.*”$^{13}$

To be fully visceral, on the other hand, requires the removal of all direct communicative power, to not be “claiming anything.” This might be possible, particularly if you argue that my earlier proposition of music as partly representational is a little wishy-washy. In fact, this sort of critique is an established point of debate:

> “Some philosophers seem convinced that art _is_ essentially representation \[…]. Other philosophers, apparently struggling for a compromise, argue that while literature and visual art are representative arts, music is not—a claim that, unhappily, begs a question: if there are “representative arts” and “non-representative” arts, what common feature do they have that authorises us to call them both “art”? Representation being ruled out, we need to find a replacement essential feature.$^{14}$

However, a perspective on art by Susanne Langer$^{15}$ actually seems to bolster our model, arguing that art is all about expressing feeling through symbol. In this way, the initial feeling or set of ideas that a stimuli or ‘object’ sparks is not *really* what art aims to represent, but rather to symbolise them *through* the medium. For example, a major chord might symbolise happiness, where the word “happiness” in a typical communicative setting would simply *point* to the concept of happiness, as a sign, rather than a symbol. A fully visceral approach therefore requires symbolism to be quite hidden, working closely with the medium for symbolism, and not tangible objects from the natural world. As Dr. Ellie Anderson explains in reference to music, “We might say that the feeling is in the work; it’s not referring back to the creator, or even back to you, the listener.”$^{16}$

Applying this crudely to language, we see that the elements of language *could* be interpreted as words and symbols, acting as signs to concepts, or, more powerfully, we can consider the elements of language as including higher-level structures like sentences and the gaps between them, allowing for language to “invite” people into concepts symbolically through structure, even without the direct use of metaphor.$^{17}$ In other words, “language (all language) is a medium for experiencing experience.”$^{18}$ 

I believe this emphasis on symbols rather than signal (or, “a system to pointing”$^{19}$) is what Terrance Hayes was getting at, when seeking out an language “unburdened by people’s expectations”:

> “I think music is the primary model—how close can you get this language to be like music and communicate feeling at the base level in the same way a composition with no words communicates meaning? It might be impossible.”$^{20}$

# Notes and References
1. I initially grimaced at this sentence, particularly the phrase “created art.” I would rather say something like “Congratulations, you have just *arted*,” but to avoid overloading the analysis with new terms and jargon, I reverted to the normal use of the word. Nevertheless, if you pay attention to my obstinate phrasing, you might find the spirit of ‘art as action’ implicit throughout my arguments.

4. In fact, it very rarely is. Lyn Hejinian’s exploration of the “Event” really nails this idea home. (see “A Fable for Now: Kate Fagan Interviews Lyn Hejinian” [here](http://cordite.org.au/interviews/fagan-hejinian/2/)).
5. At the time of writing this, I am heavily exploring the latter, so I can only apologise for any bias in phrasing—I wholeheartedly believe in the necessity and value of both approaches.
6. Music is quite tricky to place within this model for exactly this reason. Some music is clearly more specular than others, but the art form as a whole is insanely visceral. I’ve chosen to use Music as the example to show both the strengths *and* potential limitations of working with this model, before narrowing down into poetics, where it undoubtedly functions better.
