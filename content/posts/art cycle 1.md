description: A deep dive into the fundamentals of my theory
---
You are on a walk with your family, exploring a local park, feeling largely uninspired for your next project, when you see a rock. The mossy rock, one of several around you, should not interest, let alone inspire, you, but for some reason it does. Maybe it is the way the light hits one half of the rock, creating a bold shadow across its stippled surface. Maybe the way the rock leans against the tree, with a mini crater of soil as proof for its dislodging, builds a curiosity in you. Maybe it is the brown layer on the back of the moss where someone peeled it, a surprising contrast to the yellow-green everywhere else. You are captivated, and when you go home, you decide to represent that response, whatever it was, through your medium. You experiment and tweak and frown and revisit, and, at the end of an embarrassingly long process, you create something which you can engage with, and on engagement experience a powerful one, like the one that inspired you. Congratulations, you have just created art.$^1$

This description could have applied to a painter copying a rock from memory or direct observation; a poet describing the rock and its details, or even a musician composing a lyric-less song. The process could have applied to any artform, and in fact, I posit that the existence of this progression is what *defines* the process of ‘art’.

There is much to be clarified about each of the parts of this image, which is what the rest of this essay concerns itself with. 

# The Mossy Rock
# Notes
1. I grimace at the above sentence, specifically the word “created art.” I would rather say “Congratulations, you have just *arted*,” but to avoid overloading the analysis with new terms and jargon, I will try to make peace with art as a noun; just pay attention the spirit of ‘art as action’ implicit throughout my arguments. (I may also one day swap every instance of “art” to a verb form in protest—time will tell…)
