description: A watertight theory on the artistic process
---
I present one way of thinking about the underlying thread behind the many approaches artists have, across artforms and time and culture, that is, I answer the question, “what does it mean, at the most basic level to create or respond to art?”

# 0: The Semantics of Things
To make any meaningful theory about anything, we must battle the notorious wall that is ambiguity. What do we mean when we say the word “language”? what about “beauty”? We will encounter ambiguities like these throughout this essay, but the first I’d like to address is the word “art” itself. In a sense, this essay is a *definition* of that word, and so I can do whatever I want to the word, provided the change provides a substantial and meaningful boost to our understanding of the concept at hand. My change? Treat art primarily as a verb, not a noun. Throughout this essay, if I use the word ‘art’ as a noun, it should be thought of as the participle ‘arting,’ for example in phrases like “…whenever art is practiced” should be read “…whenever *arting* is practiced,” but nowhere should the phrase “X makes art” occur, because “X makes *arting*” is illogical. The summarised reason for this change is that, in my opinion, we load a ridiculous weight onto this one word, and trying to get it to do so much only leads to ambiguities, which is what this essay fights tenaciously against. 

The next point on the language of this essay is that I will often use invented terms to create a necessary distance from the nuances of the words as used in everyday speech, since my proposal is in some ways a counter-intuitive description of the artistic process. I will therefore embolden the first instance all invented terms (either micro-neologisms or crucial reinterpretations as above) and summarise their definitions in a glossary at the end (although I will strive to make their initial introductions clear, too).
# 1:  The Art Cycle
You are on a walk with your family, exploring a local park, feeling largely uninspired and ready to go home, when you see a rock. The mossy rock, one of several around you, should not interest, let alone inspire, you, but for some reason it does. Maybe it is the way the light hits one half of the rock, creating a bold shadow across the many yellow-green spots. Maybe the way the rock leans against the tree, with a mini crater of soil as proof for its dislodging, builds a curiosity in you. Maybe it is the brown layer on the back of the moss where someone peeled it, that intrigues you. For some reason you are captivated, and when you go home, you decide to represent$^1$ that *response,* whatever it was, through your medium. You experiment and tweak and frown and revisit, and, at the end of an embarrassingly long process, you create something which you can engage with, and on engagement rekindle the very feeling that inspired you. Congratulations, you have just *arted.*

This description could have applied to a visual-artist painting that rock from memory; a poet arriving home to describe the rock and its details; a musician composing a completely instrumental, lyric-less song that feels like what it felt to view that rock. The process could have been applied to every artform, and in fact I posit that the existence of this process is what *defines* arting. If the process does not match this, it is not an artistic process at all. Of course, there is much to be explicitly addressed here. Most strikingly, there are several processes that do not appear to have any such “mossy rock,” yet seem to be art regardless. My argument is that just because the rock is hard to see visually, does not mean it does not exist. The rock can be internal or external, a precise, closed moment in time or an all-encompassing concept. The point is that there is *always* a conscious or subconscious reference point for the process of artistic engagement. 

You may wonder why I called this a “cycle,” since my description so far has been quite linear. The cyclic link occurs whenever another **arter** engages with the work created, and feels a response. It may be identical to the initial arter, or it may be completely different. Thus, this work is **subjective;** each subject experiences a different response and is inspired in different ways. 

\[talk about how the simulated response is pretending to be someone who is outside the mind of the artist, and has little to no insight into the culture or history of the speaker. Mention Stein’s quote of only being able to write either for herself or for a stranger, and M. Oliver’s of how during writing you should have exactly that approach too.\]

# The Medium
\[Talk about how the nicest way to describe this “middle” point between responses is not “paint” or “dance”, but visual, sound, conceptual, kinesthetic,  etc, and each artform engages with multiple of these media. A poem engages on the sound level, visual level, and on the conceptual, and in the process combines these core elements into different ways, for example line breaks, which affect visual and sound (and sometimes concept). It’s why you can play at the character level, the word level, the sentence level, or the paragraph level, and still create good art]

\[overview of both forms of engagement with the Media (“abstract” collection of mediums)]
There are many ways to go about re-representing an internal response, but they all fall generally into one of two categories:
1. To use the medium as a “means to an end” to get at a direct, pure representation of a thing, to let the simulated response be as faithful as possible.
2. To use the medium *as* the thing, in order to let the simulated response be as faithful as possible.
In other words, you can lean inward, looking at the medium and the internal instinctive feelings you with to invoke, or you can look *outward,* looking at the mossy rock itself, and trying to represent it faithfully. 

Of course, the rock can be an internal or abstract concept, for example trying to represent an event that happened to you faithfully, as in memoir, or to relay an emotion directly, as in confessional poetry. But all of these are often still outward, whenever they focus on the thing, the object, the rock, in a very representational way (let me tell you what the rock was), as opposed to a visceral one (let me make feel how the rock felt). 

# Viscera and the Medium
\[talk about how we are not just playing in the medium but are trying to re-represent the response through the medium.]

# Objects and the Medium
\[talk about how we are not “telling” the response; that’s not the point. The point is representing the rock faithfully to recreate the response as it was experienced from the perspective of the viewer (quote about how editing is to make it as it was from viewer’s perspective). 

Talk about what the “Object” means: the rock itself.]

# The Goal of Arting
My claim is that the former is only successful if, in addition to understanding what the rock was, the audience is able to also feel a response at the rock; and the latter is only successful if, in addition to experiencing abstract, instinctive feelings, the audience is able to also feel a response at those instincts. Note that it is not strictly necessary, therefore, to convey the rock. It is simply necessary to attempt to convey the response to it. 

Remember, however, that the response is up to the audience, because the viewing process is subjective. Thus, nothing about the art process is guaranteed. Neither the rock nor its response are stable and fixed, but rather are perfectly fluid, completely indiscernible from the work alone. If I write a poem that describes a rock in detail, the audience has no way of knowing whether my inspiration was the rock, or if the rock is just a visceral metaphor to address a more abstract inspiration source. This is why it is completely futile to focus on works produced by the artistic process.

To art well is to find the necessary balance between the Viscera and the Object, that produces the simulated response for the artist nicely, thus allowing other audience members to receive a similar, albeit unidentical, response.

# Notes
1. Or ‘show.’ This step is exactly why the advice “show, don’t tell” is so pervasive. The very heart of arting is to express things in a way that goes beyond the simple boundaries of language. Linguistic arts risk missing this power and shortcutting the telling part, without regard to the endomedial or exomedial that arters typically focus thrive within.
