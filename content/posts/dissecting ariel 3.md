description: Searching for depth in one of her more simple-looking poems.

This one seems to be doing very little, but of course with time that opinion might change.$^1$

# Simple tools in complex places
A standout feature of this poem is the use of very simple phrases. Several lines describe one object in very clear ways, for example the first line, describing the bruise itself:

> Color floods to the spot, dull purple.

This factual presentation can do many things depending on context, for example portray childlike simplicity or a finality. Here, I think it is serving to portray Plath’s cold acceptance of the nature of life and its end. The last stanza shows this particularly well, where each line is a really simple end-stopped phrase beginning with “the”.  She’s presenting these things as they are, with very few flourishes. An interpretation of this poem is quite simple: an unnamed, “washed-out” body has a bruise and then dies; and the sea pushes at, and then recedes from, a hole in a rock. What’s interesting are the ways the body and the sea relate with each other, and how the fly and mirror fit into everything.

# The sea and the human
There are a few clear connections between the sea$^2$ and the body:
- The sea “obsessively” concerns itself with this rock, and similarly the body described is completely void except this bruise. 
- The sea has to eventually surrender, as do the physical organs.

# Additional Images
I think the mirror represents an ability to reflect the world back to itself, to be a useful person in the world. The mirror being covered puts an end to all of that.

The mention of a fly brings decay to mind, and the crawling doom furthers the deathly imagery. 

Overall, I see this poem primarily as an expression of two feelings, contradictory yet both existing together in the speaker’s mind: dread and acceptance. 

# Notes
1. I’m guessing I’ll have more to say on this when I’ve read *Cut* properly.
2. The poem *Blackberrying* really expands on the idea of the sea and the rock as linked to dread and expectation. I might make stronger comparative analysis here at some point.
