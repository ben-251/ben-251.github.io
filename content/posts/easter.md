Like many Christians worldwide, I've been reflecting on Jesus' death and resurrection. The sermons, conversations, and Bible reading this Easter all hit particularly powerfully this Easter, bringing me to the following realisations:



# 1. The Gospel changes everything
It's tempting to think of Jesus' life as just another event in the long, complicated history of humanity, but what Jesus did that weekend is more important than anything any man has ever accomplished. The closer I get to God, the more I realise how significant this ***good news*** really is.

# 2. The resurrection solidifies Jesus' authority
If Easter never happened, then we would have no reason to take Jesus seriously. He predicted he would die and be raised to life, and he did exactly that. We have every confidence that Jesus is the Son of God, and that what He says is true. Everything he tells us about ourselves and Himself and the Kingdom of God; every promise, every blessing; every command we get to exercise faith and obedience in, *all* of this is ours in Christ.
# 3. Jesus deserves all praise
In Luke 19, Jesus enters Jerusalem and his disciples praise Him, to the Pharisees' disapproval. They ask Jesus to rebuke his disciples, because though the Pharisees believe that Jesus is a knowledgeable teacher, they do not believe he is Lord. But look at what Jesus says:

> He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.”

Nothing can strip the Lord of His worthiness—Jesus deserves all praise.
