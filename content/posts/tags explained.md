description: A breakdown of the tags used in the blog
---
Each post will have at least one tag. I'll update this page as new tags prove necessary (or otherwise).
- `#art`: mainly discussing areas like writing, visual art, music, creativity, and aesthetics in a philosophical sense
- `#books`: reviews, read-lists, all that good stuff :)
- `#DA` : my ‘Dissecting Ariel’ series
- `#math`: recent maths learning and such. For proofs or formal writeups of recent theories, see `/mathematics` instead
- `#meta`: posts about posts, site structure, navigation, the web dev behind this site, or any other meta-esque topics
- `#mind`: thoughts on psychology, cognitive science, epistemology, neuroscience, etc
- `#poetry`: recent poetry thoughts, analyses and process updates. Excludes pages created solely to present poems. That goes in `/poems`
- `#poetics`: analysing how poetry functions
- `#SV-theory`: my ‘Specuvisceral’ theory of art.
