description: An exploration of what good contemporary verse is capable of

As far as poetic traditions go, *In the Country of Resurrection* is quite objective, in a similar vein to that of the Imagist poets, perhaps. The poem operates partially on the level of the ‘Image,’ as described my Ezra Pound, but also operates quite heavily through structure and associations. Notably missing from either description, however, is the common poetic devices of sound/rhythm. There are elements of sound that come into play, but the structure and use of line is what really carries the poem, I think.

# Final Turn
\[how the four lines at the end accomplish such a powerful move, that is only possible because of the setup of the rest of the poem’s set of emotions and associations]
