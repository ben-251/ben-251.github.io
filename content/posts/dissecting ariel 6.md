# The small, simple lines
> Your small
> 
> Brother is making
> His balloon squeak like a cat.

One way this poem leans into the imagined perspective of a child is through breaks that shrink the line at critical moments, conveying size through structure. Scattered throughout this poem are some particularly simple lines, often broken after just a few words, and forming sentences that are very simple in diction and structure. The example given above shows this nicely. The image itself is of a childish one, and the words “small” and “like a cat” ground this image in simplicity. The enjambment occurring after “small” makes for a two word line, resulting in almost no possible stress play going on. Yet, the same stanza that contains the lonely line “He bites,” contains a fifteen-syllable, thirteen-word line: “A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it.” The result is a feeling of instability, not anxious but playful and child-like. 

These lines aren’t concerned with the structure of consistent meter. However, this isn’t to say it doesn’t play with sound and rhythm at all. We see in stanza three a very smooth rhythm, for example lines 12-15, where the sound creates steady anchor points (“and these travell-**ing** / globes of thin air, red, **green**, Delight-**ing**”); or where careful caesuric placement allows the reader to completely control the reading pace, and, by extension, the readers feelings while exploring this scene. The words “thin”, “air”, “red”, and “green” have nearly identical stress when pronounced in this line, meaning after each word we have no choice but to slow. There is no bouncy melodic line to speed things along. In this sense the poem plays with meter only through defiantly refusing to follow its expected patterns. 

# Burst bubble
The final stanza creates a powerful closure. Its two sentences employ assonance to bring cohesion, and the technique of equal stress returns again, through lines that refuse to have any major weak stresses. Marking the stresses overall (bold for particularly strong stresses) might look like this:

> THEN **SITS**
> **BACK** | **FAT** JUG
> cont em PLAT | ing a **WORLD** | as CLEAR | as **WAT** er |
> A **RED**
> **SHRED** in his | LIT-tle | **FIST**.

The result of this peculiar rhythm is a slow, confused reflection, contrasting with the vibrant energy of much of the rest of the poem. 

# Balloon’s Inner World
This poem is punctuated with questions and images related to the inside of the balloon. The speaker from the start seems to know clearly that the balloon contains only air, and that the balloon is not trying to hide this (“guileless and clear”, “globes of thin air”). Later, we see the child try to uncover the secrets of the balloon, “Seeming to see / A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,” just before the air of the balloon is again described, this time as “a world as clear as water.”
