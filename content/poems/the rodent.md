His eyes were locked on a flowing   
crowd, who paid no mind to his lifeless state;  
My breath was merely meant to embalm him.  
My Hello was too intrusive,  
a blood transfusion.  
A heartbeat began, cautious, careful, confused,   
  
as newly-raised creatures often are.  
On seeing its rescuer, his lungs took  
my word and twisted  
it into a desperate cry. *Hello-hell-  
o-hello-hello-hello-hell-*  

I cannot defend myself. I shrunk  
away as though I never saw the miracle.   
I let the people sweep me away,   
turning my regrets into calculated apathy.  
I risked one glance to preserve his imageâ€”
     
He shrivelled there and then.
